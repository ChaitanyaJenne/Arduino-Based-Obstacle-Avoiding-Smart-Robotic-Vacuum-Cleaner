# Arduino-Based-Obstacle-Avoiding-Smart-Robotic-Vacuum-Cleaner
An Arduino-based smart robotic vacuum cleaner is an autonomous cleaning robot that uses sensors like ultrasonic and IR for obstacle and edge detection. Controlled by an Arduino board, it navigates and cleans floors efficiently using a vacuum motor, making it a cost-effective solution for home automation.
